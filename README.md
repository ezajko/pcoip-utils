pcoip-utils
===========

Command line utils to work with PCoIP hardware endpoints

* firmware-flash: upgrade PCoIP firmware on a single device; expects firmware in "firmware.all"
* cmitool: WIP to call RPC stuff on zero clients and host cards by CMI interface
* reset-client: powers off a client machine via the host card, and then WOLs it

Some assembly required; please examine the scripts to make sure you understand them before you run them.
